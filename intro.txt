Welcome to "The Dungeon" (Dun-Dun-Dunnnn) !!!!!
I am your host, Zaz
We are stuck in the dungeon and we need YOU to find a way out, and  
if you don't reach the end...well, I don’t want to frighten you but, 
your soul is stuck in the dungeon forever, and ever, and ever.
That shouldn’t be your concern because I KNOW you can do it!
Well, I better get to explaining the fun part, the game!
You will be able to buy supplies and sell treasures from & to merchants.
Merchants will increase their prices throughout the game so beware. (Those prices will get ya!)
You must survive 5 rooms full of monsters for the exit to unlock, the last room being the SORCERER. The strongest monster to ever live, he has only been defeated once. With glowing eyes of red his looks alone could kill. Once you defeat him you will be able to escape!
A main priority is; keeping you and your party full so that your health doesn't deteriorate
My last and final tip...don't let the sorcerer's anger reach 100 (you don’t even want to know why, you just don’t!)
Good luck! May the strongest survive (mwahaha)
